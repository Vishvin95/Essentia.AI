# Total Amount and Item Extraction Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Incorrect Total Amount in Response
**Problem:** For the query "Got some cheese for 150 rupees, about 200g", the response showed:
- `extractedData.amount`: 150 ✓ (correct)
- `totalAmount`: 454 ❌ (incorrect - why?)

**Root Cause:** The response was showing the **accumulated total** from the database expense record (which aggregates multiple voice entries for the same user/group/date) instead of the **current extracted amount**.

### Issue 2: Generic Item Extraction
**Problem:** The item was being extracted as "Miscellaneous" instead of the specific item "cheese".

**Root Cause:** The AI model's system message wasn't specific enough about identifying actual product names vs. generic categories.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Corrected Total Amount in Response

**Before:**
```csharp
TotalAmount = savedExpense.TotalAmount,  // Accumulated total from database
Currency = savedExpense.Currency,       // Database currency
```

**After:**
```csharp
TotalAmount = (decimal)extractedData.Amount,  // Current extracted amount
Currency = extractedData.Currency,           // Extracted currency for consistency
```

**Result:** Response now shows the exact amount that was extracted, not the accumulated database total.

### Fix 2: Enhanced Item Extraction

**Before:**
```
"You are an expense extraction assistant. When users describe purchases, extract the items they buy, quantity they buy, merchant/place from where they buy and cost of spent along with currency."
```

**After:**
```
"You are an expense extraction assistant. When users describe purchases, identify the SPECIFIC ITEM they bought, not generic categories. Examples: 'Got some cheese for 150 rupees' → item='cheese' (not 'food' or 'miscellaneous'). 'I bought 3 coffees for 12 dollars' → item='coffee', amount=12. 'Paid for gas' → item='gasoline' or 'fuel'. Always extract the actual product/item name mentioned in the speech, and focus on the total money spent."
```

**Also enhanced function parameter description:**
```
item = "The specific item or product purchased (e.g., 'cheese', 'coffee', 'gasoline'). Use the actual item name mentioned, not generic categories like 'food' or 'miscellaneous'."
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

| Speech Input | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| "Got some cheese for 150 rupees" | totalAmount: 454, item: "Miscellaneous" | totalAmount: 150, item: "cheese" |
| "Bought coffee for 5 dollars" | totalAmount: varies, item: "Food" | totalAmount: 5, item: "coffee" |
| "Filled up gas for 45 dollars" | totalAmount: varies, item: "Miscellaneous" | totalAmount: 45, item: "gasoline" |

## Database vs Response Behavior

**Important Note:** The database still accumulates expenses correctly. The fix only affects the **response format** to show what was actually extracted from the current voice input.

- **Database:** Still aggregates multiple voice entries for same user/group/date
- **Response:** Now shows the current extraction details for better user feedback

## Files Modified

1. **Controllers/InvoiceController.cs**
   - Fixed response totalAmount to use extractedData.Amount
   - Fixed response currency to use extractedData.Currency

2. **Services/ExpenseExtractionService.cs**
   - Enhanced system message with specific examples
   - Improved item parameter description
   - Added guidance to avoid generic categories

3. **test_amount_item_fixes.ps1**
   - Comprehensive test suite to validate both fixes

## Testing

Run `.\test_amount_item_fixes.ps1` to validate:
- ✅ Response totalAmount matches extracted amount
- ✅ Specific items are extracted (not "Miscellaneous")
- ✅ Currency consistency between extracted and response data
- ✅ Various item types (food, beverages, fuel, etc.)

The fixes ensure that the voice expense API provides accurate, user-friendly responses that clearly show what was extracted from their speech input.
